# Clustering-GPS-data-using-DBSCAN-
In this work we tray to cluster GPS DATA to find regions of interest which characterised by the most important density.
this regions may be the locations where the walker had stay on for a periode (spped == 0). 
or where he taked time to walk around a specific position for a peroid of time.
